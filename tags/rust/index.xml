It is a Ruby language parser.
I tried multiple ways and found one that is very (VERY) controversial, but I think it deserves it&amp;rsquo;s own article.
Traditional way Let&amp;rsquo;s say you have a library in C. Just for simplicity, Rust is not special here.
How can you use it in C++?</description></item><item><title>lib-ruby-parser</title><link>https://iliabylich.github.io/2020-11-23-lib-ruby-parser/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://iliabylich.github.io/2020-11-23-lib-ruby-parser/</guid><description>Intro So, I&amp;rsquo;m ready to announce that I have finished working on a new Ruby parser. It&amp;rsquo;s called lib-ruby-parser.
Key features:
It&amp;rsquo;s fast. It&amp;rsquo;s written in Rust and it&amp;rsquo;s slightly faster than Ripper. The difference is about 1-2% on my machine. It has a beautiful interface. Every single node has its own type that is documented. For example, take a look at CSend node that represents &amp;ldquo;conditional send&amp;rdquo; like foo&amp;amp;.bar. Here&amp;rsquo;s a list of all defined nodes .</description></item></channel></rss>
